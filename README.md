# Yellow Dog Word Predictor

A word suggestion system based on an n-gram model. Created as the Data Science 
specialization (Johns Hopkins University, Coursera) final project.

Developed by Ivan Lysiuchenko in September-October, 2018.

## Overview

This is a collection of R scripts which can be used to train an n-gram model,
obtaining a tool able to predict the next word based on the user input.

Also you can find some functions allowing to evaluate the n-gram model 
performance on a testing set: accuracy and perplexity.

Once an n-gram model is built, you can run the prediction algorithm as part
of a web (Shiny) application.
